# start
You're Dad. You jerk awake to the vibration on your wrist. It's 5:45. 
Time for the first choice of the day.

* Get out of bed -> bedroom
* Snooze the watch -> bed

# bedroom
You remove the warm, cozy blanket and torture yourself with the cold air. 
Another day, another battle to fight.

You're now standing next to the bed in your underwear.

* Tip toe to the bathroom -> bathroom
* Fuck it, I'm going back to bed -> bed

# bed
You're wrapped up in your warm cocoon, safe from the looming responsibilities awaiting you outside. 
You know you're only delaying the inevitable.

* Get out of bed -> bedroom
* Linger in your nest -> bed2

# bed2
You feel the spirit of Marcus Aurelius gaze at you in contempt. 
You should be up, doing human things.

* Get out of bed, damn it -> bedroom
* I bet Marcus didn't have a bed as warm and comfortable as this one -> bed3

# bed3
As you meditate in your dark womb, time passes. 
It's now too late to go for your long morning walk before the kids wake up. 
This choice leads to a timeline where eventually you develop heart disease and die in your 50s. 

How tragic. You never get to meet your grandchildren.

* But the warmth... [exit]
> Your path in the warmth timeline is sealed.

# bathroom
You're in the small, cluttered bathroom. You have a routine. 
Specific steps to execute in a specific order.

* Take a piss -> piss

# piss
You sit down on the toilet like your mother taught you. 
Yellow water comes out of you, but does not make a mess.

* Contemplate... [exit]
> You wonder what it would look like if a piglet was wearing stockings in all of its legs. 
> You decide to try and draw it later, if you remember. 
>
> CONTINUED IN THE NEXT EPISODE
